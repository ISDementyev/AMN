The equation of any circle centered at $(0,0)$ in a 2D-Cartesian coordinate system can be expressed as the following:

\begin{equation}
    x^{2} + y^{2} = r^{2}
\end{equation}

Where $r$ is the radius of the circle. As can be deduced from empirical evidence, we can assume a linear wavefront propagation with respect to time. 
Let

\begin{equation}
    r = \nu t
\end{equation}

Where $\nu$ is the linear wavefront velocity. 
Hence, after substituting $(2)$ into $(1)$ and rearranging some variables, we can express the time progressed as a function of wave location as such:

\begin{equation}
    t = \frac{1}{\nu}\sqrt{x^{2} + y^{2}}
\end{equation}
